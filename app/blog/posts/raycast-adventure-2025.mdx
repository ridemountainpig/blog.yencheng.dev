2025 was a year of deep connections, surprises, and breakthroughs for me and Raycast. Moving from a simple user to a community ambassador, this journey has been far more exciting than I ever imagined.

## Becoming a Raycast Ambassador and Hosting Raycast Cafe Taichung

In early 2025, I was incredibly honored to be invited to become a `Raycast Ambassador`. This wasn't just a title; it was a mission to share the tools I love with more people.

I co-hosted `Raycast Cafe Taichung` with the Raycast team. This was my first time organizing an in-person community meetup. Seeing many Raycast enthusiasts gather together to share their workflows and custom commands was truly moving. The transition from online discussions to real-life interactions is a memory I still cherish today.

## From X Connections to Meeting in Tokyo

Beyond the Taiwan community, I also connected with many active members of the [Raycast Japan Community](https://x.com/Raycast0731) on X, including [Yano](https://x.com/nagauta_jp), [Seiji](https://x.com/se_eiji), and many others. Their enthusiasm was truly incredible, and in late 2025, they hosted a `Raycast Hackathon` and a `Tokyo Meetup`.

Along with [Yiwei](https://x.com/1weiho), another Taiwan Raycast Ambassador, I made the trip to Tokyo to join them. This was a significant milestone for me, as it was the first time I’ve ever attended an international community event. I was truly happy to be part of it with the Raycast team and the community, and it remains one of my most cherished memories.

## A Dream Come True: First Meeting with the Raycast Team

On the day of the event, we arrived early at the hotel to meet the Raycast team members who had flown in from Europe: [Thomas](https://x.com/thomaspaulmann), [Pedro](https://x.com/peduarte), and Stephanie.

Having followed their updates on X and YouTube for so long, they felt like "tech celebrities" to me. When Thomas stood in front of me and greeted me, it felt surreal, as if I had stepped right into a dream from my screen. We shared many great conversations. Their humility and passion for the product only made me more certain that Raycast is a team with a soul.

## Developer's Pride: 100 Extensions and Raycast Recap

On the development front, 2025 was also a highly productive year. I continued contributing to Raycast extensions and officially reached the milestone of `100` extension contributions mid-year.

To my surprise, in the official `Raycast 2025 Recap Extension Highlights` year-end review, I was featured as "Most Installs by Contributor" in the final Raycast News of the year. Seeing my name and contributions recognized by the official team is the highest form of validation and encouragement for any developer.

## Side Story: Raycast Memories Under Tokyo Tower

Apart from the meetups, I spent some time exploring the city. I captured a moment in front of Tokyo Tower, wearing my Raycast hoodie, that felt like a milestone. It reminds me how a simple passion for a tool can lead to incredible adventures in distant places.

## Conclusion: Looking Forward to 2026

2025 was a wonderful and fulfilling year. Raycast not only boosted my productivity but also led me to international stages and introduced me to many like-minded friends.

Standing at the beginning of 2026, I can't wait to see what new sparks I can create with Raycast. Whether it's developing more useful extensions or continuing to grow the community, I will move forward with this passion.

Stay tuned, the adventure continues! 🚀
